<big>CachyOS 22.12</big>

This is our last Release for this year. It includes a lot of fixes and the ISO got more polished.
The zfshostid is now working as expected, also the ranking of the mirrors does also rank now the CachyOS Mirrors to provide a faster online installation.
Aditonally we will Release a ISO which includes llvm 15 to have a compatbility for newer AMD Cards.
The llvm 15 ISO does NOT work for x86-64 CPUs and just works for newer (2012+) CPUs.
